# 32bitARM_like_CPU_design
This repository contains the complete source code, design files, and course materials for building an ARM-like CPU from scratch using Verilog workshop hosted in www.whyrd.in . The project focuses on educational purposes, teaching the principles of RISC-based microarchitecture, memory management, and instruction decoding.

CPUs Instruction set 
This CPU can execute the following commands. 

Data Processing: ADD SUB AND ORR 

Memory Operation: STR and LDR 

Branch: B 

Also, cover all the conditional mnemonics from ARM LRM, as shown below in the snapshot.
